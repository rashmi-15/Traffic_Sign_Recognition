# Traffic_Sign_Recognition

Description : In this project, we will be using a pre-trained model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

Steps we follow are : 
            1. Build a ML model 
            2. Train the model 
            3. Save model as a file 
            4. Build a flask application 
            5. Read inputs from user 
            6. Return outputs to the user
            
Some of the important Packages used are : 
            Torch 
            Torchvision 
            Numpy 
            cv2 
            PIL 
            Matplotlib
